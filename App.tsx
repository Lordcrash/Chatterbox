    //    into an iframe from a different origin (like hf.space), this script
    //    CANNOT access or modify elements *inside* that iframe.
    //    This is a fundamental browser security feature.
    // 2. Shadow DOM: If <gradio-app> uses a Shadow DOM for its internal
    //    structure, document.querySelectorAll() from the parent page might not
    //    pierce it to find the H1.
    // 3. Timing: The H1 might not be present in the DOM when this script runs,
    //    even with a timeout. This approach is fragile.
    //
    // If the H1 is part of the cross-origin iframe content, this will not work.
    // Changes would need to be made in the Gradio app's own source code.
    const timerId = setTimeout(attemptHideTitle, 2000); // 2-second delay, adjust if necessary

    return () => clearTimeout(timerId); // Cleanup the timeout if the component unmounts

            The <gradio-app> element renders the Gradio interface.
            The Gradio JS script (loaded in index.html) defines this custom element.
            TypeScript now recognizes 'gradio-app' due to the global declaration in types.ts.
            It typically handles its own loading state and responsiveness.
            Ensure the `src` attribute points to a valid Gradio app URL.

            Note on hiding internal elements:
            Directly hiding specific elements (like a "Chatterbox TS demo" heading) 
            *within* the Gradio application (loaded in the iframe below) from this 
            parent React application is generally not possible due to browser 
            Same-Origin Policy if the content is cross-origin. 
            The useEffect hook above attempts this based on user request, but it is
            subject to these browser security restrictions and timing issues.
